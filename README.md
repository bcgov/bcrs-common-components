How to publish new or upgraded component to npm?

- run `lerna bootstrap --hoist` to update depencency (for local development)

- run `lerna version --include-merged-tags` and select a version (Do not run this from fork. It depends on git tags to identify changes)

- run `lerna publish from-package` to publish to npm
